Gravity Forms Email Blacklist
================
### Description

Email Blacklist Add-on for Gravity Forms was built to help block submissions from users with generic or competitors email addresses. Prevent the user form viewing the form's Confirmation or Notifications and remove non qualified leads from being collected.

This plugin allows site admins to create a list of domains that if used in an email field on a Gravity Form will cause a validation error and block the submission. A default email blacklist and validation message can be created to use across all form email fields. These default settings can be overridden on a per email field basis.

Default settings can be added in the  'Forms' > 'Settings' > 'Email Blacklist'. To add settings to an individual email field just add one to the form and got to the 'Advanced Settings' tab.
